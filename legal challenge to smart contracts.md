How can one challenge the validity of a self-executing contract?


I wanted to throw out some scenarios where parties might utilize a country’s court system for challenges. This could be much denser, but it should illuminate some risks.


Anonymous parties(Decentralized Platform) - They don’t know who is on the other side of contract so they can not challenge validity of the contract as it exists on the blockchain because the other party is unknown. They cannot avail themselves to any court system where the other party maintains business or resides.


One or more known party (Dentralized Platform - Reputation) - This is a possibility in a decentralized marketplace where, typically if the vendor is a goodfaith/reputation business, a party can be challenged in a court of law within any jurisdiction where they have substantial presence. 


Business to Business (Decentralized Platform)

Either can bring suit to challenge the validity of contract execution in a court where the company is substantially present (The nexus requirement will vary from country to country).


** So the first place to minimize exposure to exposure to the court system would be to have an air-tight arbitration clause built into the expression of the peer-to-peer contract and the terms of use for the site where the contracts are executed. This does not solve the problem, but at least marginalizes the impact of politics, whimsical public policy with the varying countries’ legal systems. (Arbitration in the international context is supported by a near-universally signed treaty. If both parties are in the same country the arbitration clauses may be easier to challenge.)


Anonymous parties (w/ third-party platform) - This would be the case with an exchange that had a place of business where an anonymous party could use their court system to void the contract and return the parties to their previous financial positions . Or even a legitimate peer-to-peer marketplace that worked off a proprietary platform (Think Etherbay - bring suit in the jurisdiction where Etherbay incorporates. Reinforces the need for DAOs). 


One or more known party,including B2B ( w/ third party platform) - The aggrieved party would use the court system of either the known party or in absence of the knowledge, the third-party platform. (And potentially the server hosting businesses. Kanye West’s lawyers did not know who created Coinye West, so they sued Amazon over website hosting - makes the Open Transactions system of federated servers a necessity as a risk management tool.)


**In the case of a third-party platform, clear terms of use agreement, including an arbitration clause for any “material” dispute that arises out of contracts executed within the platform.



The Big Reveal


So what is all this fuss about Arbitration. You want arbitration for two reasons: (1) Choice of Law and (2) Choice of forum. Once you no longer exposed to the political apparatus of any given legal system all parties can better evaluate the liability risks associated with “smart contracts”.


Choice of Forum - Most developed countries have at least one arbitral organization. Forums are important because they determine the rules of procedure, which has a high impact on the costs associated and potentially the modes of discovery and preliminary rulings (Imagine being able to file one memoranda that says the contract is self-executing, “smart” by nature and since the terms of agreement show no fraudulent inducement/mistake/coercion the challenge has no merit. Thus fulfilling the promise of “smart law”.)


Choice of Law - This is important for two reasons: a legal system that has made advancements on recognizing digital legal instruments, digital evidence, and blockchain technology will always be preferable to some analog expression of law (Also, common law principles of contract creation are general enough to include “smart contract” in my opinion). The second reason is the potential of a new body of law, constructed specifically with blockchain technologies in mind, could emerge and be the standard selection (that is where I get dreamy-eyed). This is where nicotravia’s thoughts about defining a legal definition wouldn’t be imposed by Etherium or any other contracting party but as the adoption of a established body of law that is favorable to blockchain technology.


That is all for now. This where my head is these days. Glad to have a reason to spew my thoughts. 

I think its possible to envision the possibility of partially collateralized smart contracts, but I may need some more time.  I appreciate any feedback
