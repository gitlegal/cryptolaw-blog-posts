The Inevitable Increase of Arbitration in the Bitcoin Ecosystem



Many of us have come around to the idea that Bitcoin is a superior currency and payment network than that of those propped up by the legacy banking systems, worldwide. However, the way we view its interaction with legal systems is decidedly analog. Residents of any given country are accustomed to their local courts as an adequate enforcement mechanism for contractual rights and liabilities, yet this relationship between government and citizen has little to no effect in the future of Bitcoin commerce. When dealing with parties divided by continents or perhaps masked by the relative anonymity of the Bitcoin network, arbitration will be the mainstay of dispute resolution. 


I can make this statement confidently because a healthy majority of countries in the world are a signatory to the 1958 international treaty, the Convention on the Recognition of Foreign Arbitral Awards, commonly referred to as the New York Convention. As you may imagine, the convention was not drafted with peer-to-peer commerce in mind. It sought to bring a stable framework to large-scale international commerce that couldn’t be affected by politicized legal systems. Private agreements to arbitrate and the resulting arbitral awards (money), have more legal import internationally than any determination made in court. However the courts have a role to play as an enforcement mechanism to seize assets located in their jurisdiction. 


Ah, there’s the rub. We still need the old men in wigs and the men with guns to enforce these agreements. Let me lure you back to the world of Bitcoin for a moment to assure you that their role will be di minimus.  


In a twitter-sourced list of items or digital assets that can be placed within a blockchain model curated by Antonis Polemitis of Ledra Capital, nearly all can be placed in the purview of the context of what digital law pioneer, Nick Szabo coined as “Smart Contract”. Further, if we build on these critical foundations, we may arrive at legal system based on the historically stateless merchant law, to which Justus Ranvier refers to brilliantly as Lex Cryptographia. We finally arrive at a place where the posited limitations of self-executing contracts are further minimized by semi-autonomous forms of arbitration, which I theorized in a post over at the Digital Common Law Institute. I contend that a modified form of traditional arbitration is merely the bridge to a more trustless economy, where the intersection of scrupled innovators and the corrupt or inept never intersect.


In drafting a contract, the arbitration clause is often referred to as the “midnight clause” because the lawyers wait till the eleventh hour and pay little attention to them. However, I would argue of their utmost importance in a blockchain economy. The clause traditionally has two main components: choice of law and designation of forum. 


The forum is important because of organizational reputation and predetermined procedures to facilitate the arbitration. Most countries have at least one arbitral organization (the forum) located within their borders. The U.S. has the American Arbitration Association (AAA) located in New York City. The location of the organization has little influence on the procedures they employ. An arbitration under the AAA can take place in a hotel conference room in Dubai. Virtual arbitrations have been popularized by JAMS, but I doubt their business model is ready for disputes in peer-to-peer transactions on the blockchain. The company, BitRated, has created a marketplace for arbitration services which indicates, at minimum, a perceived need in the crypto space.


The choice of law is important because the parties to a contract can select a body of law that has made advancements in recognizing digital legal instruments, digital evidence, and blockchain technology. It may be a small country that has forward-thinking legal system or potentially of a new body of law, existing outside of the constraints of politics, constructed specifically with blockchain technologies in mind, could emerge and be the standard selection.

Since the implementation of the New York Convention over 55 years ago, arbitration is the only form of dispute resolution truly recognized in international commerce and a customized version in a distributed digital economy is increasingly inevitable.
