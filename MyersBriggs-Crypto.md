What Type of Bitcoiner Are You?


If you have never taken the Myers-Briggs personality test, you should. Self awareness is an oft-unspoken virtue and the test informs the participant how they direct their energy, process information, make decisions and organize their life. Below is a modified version of the questionnaire and some good natured speculation of what type of bitcoiner you might be.


1.  Do you regularly interact with Bitcoiners on Twitter? Have you contributed more than three posts at Bitcointalk? Have you gone to a Bitcoin meetup in your area? Do you talk about bitcoin with people who have never heard of it? Have you ever gotten drunk and ask the bartender/server if they take bitcoin as payment?


If yes, you are an E for Extraversion, but before you highfive your closest bitcoin-bro or babe…


 Are your twitter interactions consistently with the same small group of bitcoiners? Did you lose your password Bitcointalk and never bothered getting a new one? Did you just go to one meetup and the made an excuse not to return, because the group didn’t feel right? Have you ever gotten drunk or high at home by yourself and asked the pizza delivery guy if he takes bitcoin? If you answered yes to any of the above, you are not an E, but an I for intraversion.


Write down whether you are an I or E. (if you are on the fence, just pick one for fun).


2. Have you done advance chart analysis on the price of Bitcoin? Have you ever read the entire code of a new altcoin on github? Did you read the whole Dorian Nakamoto article?


If you answered yes to any of these questions you are an S for Sensing.


Have you ever used the Youtube search function to find another Mike Hearn video? Have you speculated that the NSA created Bitcoin or western banks are trying to suppress the price of bitcoin? Do you think the goals of any Mastercoin, Counterparty, NXT, BitShares or even Ripple project have merit and aren’t a complete scam.


If yes, you are not an S, but an I for Intuition.


3. Have you read the entire Charlie Shrem complaint out of curiosity? Have you pitched a bitcoin development project to friends or colleagues? Are you currently employed as software developer in California? Have you read the Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper more than once?


If yes to any above, you are a T for Thinking.


Have you ever used bitcoin tipping bot like Tippercoin or Changetip? Do you own more than 1000 Dogecoin? Have you made more than five different purchases on Overstock.com, TigerDirect or SilkRoad (Or an equivalent dark market)? Do you currently sell a homemade good for bitcoin?


If yes, you are not a T, you are an F for Feeling. (Write it down)


4.  Finally, Do you think the introduction of derivative markets for Bitcoin price stability is a good thing? Do you think one day we will know who Satoshi is? Are you developed a fully functioning multi-signature wallet? Have you purchased an ASIC to mine bitcoin?


If yes to any the above you are J for Judgment.


Do you trade alt-coins? Would you consider yourself a member of an alt-coin community? Do you regularly buy bitcoin when the price drops significantly? Have you ever sent an encrypted email? 


If yes to any of these you are not a J, but rather a P for Perception


So you should have a four letter variation and since all bitcoiners are math geniuses you realize there a sixteen different variations. The following variations are an attempt to predict who you are in the Bitcoin community?
